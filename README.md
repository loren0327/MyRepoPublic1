# MyRepoPublic1
Public repo one

This is github repo setup to share any code I am working on and can share with public.
I am currently working with javascript, node.js, jquery, ajax, angular web applications.
I also will port web application to mobile android and ios directly with those vendor ide frameworks.
I will then create a version using xamarian as xplatform example.
I will first use azure cloud, messaging hub, iot hub, event hub.
I will then create version with aws cloud services.

New builds, works in progress will be found here.
Demo builds ready for testing found there.
Final builds pushed to master.

Cheers
Loren
